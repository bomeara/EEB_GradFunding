This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

Panelists may consider the following with respect to the Broader Impacts Criterion: the potential of the applicant for future broader impacts as indicated by personal experiences, professional experiences, educational experiences and future plans.

The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:

What is the potential for the proposed activity to:

* Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
* Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
* To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
* Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
* How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
* Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
