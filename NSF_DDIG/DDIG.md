## DDIG

# Core documents

Solitication: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13568/nsf13568.htm

Due date: Oct 13, 2016


# Key points

A statement labeled Context for Improvement is **required** as a Supplementary Document, not to exceed one page. This statement from the student should detail:

* how the NSF funding will substantially improve the overall dissertation project, and how it represents an **enhancement to, rather than the core of**, the student's dissertation research,
* an explanation of how the proposed research is **intellectually independent of the student's advisor**, and
* how the research can not be supported through **any research awards that support the advisor's own research**.

## Criteria

When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:

* Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
* Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

# Notes

From solicitation, with emphasis added:

Proposals whose focus falls within the scope of any cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) are eligible. Please note that DEB programs generally do not support research in marine ecology. In the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) only proposals within the scientific area of animal behavior supported by the Behavioral Systems Cluster are eligible. The duration and grant amount are flexible but must be justified by the scope of work and documented in the proposal. Grants are awarded for amounts up to **$13,000** in Direct Costs and periods of up to 24 months.

These awards are intended to provide supplemental funds for items **not normally available from the student's university or other sources**. They are not intended to provide the total costs of a student's dissertation research. Allowable items include travel to specialized facilities or field research locations and professional meetings, use of specialized research equipment, purchase of supplies and services not otherwise available, the hiring of field or laboratory assistants, fees for computerized or other forms of data, and rental of environmental chambers or other research facilities.

A statement that the student has advanced to candidacy for a Ph.D., signed and dated by the department chairperson, graduate dean, or similar administrative official is required. The proposal must be submitted through regular organizational channels (at UTK: Cayuse) by the dissertation advisor(s) on behalf of the graduate student.

Letters of support should not have any info except for that detailed in the solicitation: No "Pat is the smartest student ever"

# Budget

Because entering person-months on the budget could be construed as voluntarily committing cost sharing which is not permitted, no individuals should appear on the budget. You will need to manually remove the PI and co-PI names from the list of senior personnel in the budget.
