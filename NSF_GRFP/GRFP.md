## Why bother

Three year fellowship at decent wages ($34K/yr) to give you time to develop as a scientist. There are also side benefits: opportunity to apply for additional funds to "to take advantage of expertise, facilities, data, and field sites located abroad; to develop an international network of collaborators early in their career; to address problems of a global nature that require international cooperation; and to be prepared to collaborate successfully in international teams upon joining the United States science and engineering workforce" and "to participate in mission-related, collaborative research under the guidance of host research mentors at federal facilities and national laboratories", possible options for paid and unpaid leave to deal with childbirth/adoption and elder care, access to high performance computing resources, and access to special equipment or assistance if needed for persons with disabilities. Overall, it's a great program.

From a department's perspective, besides the benefits above it helps us build a bigger class by freeing TA or GRA lines. It also has prestige for all involved.

## Eligibility

Effective as of the 2017 competition (Fall 2016 deadlines), **graduate students are limited to only one application to the GRFP, submitted either in the first year or in the second year of graduate school**. [Undergraduates can apply in their senior year and after graduating without limit].

An exception is provided for first-year graduate students who applied to the 2016 GRFP competition in Fall 2015; these individuals may apply a second time in Fall 2016, if they are otherwise eligible.

You are ineligible if not a US citizen or national or lack permanent resident status by the application deadline.

## Deadlines

* October 24, 2016 (Monday) 5 pm local time: Life Sciences, Geosciences (computer sciences, STEM education, due a day or two later). If they're late, you are out of the competition.
* UT's office of research will need it a week ahead of time. So plan on Oct. 17 at the latest.
* Marva must also handle the applications. Plan on giving them to her at least by Oct. 10.

## Gotchas

* You must have at least two letters of rec: with only one, you're instantly booted from the competition. There's a firm Nov 3, 2016, 5 pm deadline for letters. Ask faculty (or other potential recommenders, though aim for faculty in most cases) for letters early, and make sure you ask **three** faculty to send them in (you're allowed to have up to three letters). Follow up if they haven't sent them in within a couple of days of the deadline.
* This will require getting access to Fastlane, NSF's way of submitting applications. This can be hard to deal with at first, and so make sure to leave time to deal with it. You can upload documents and then reupload them later, so don't hesitate to try now (it can reformat things in odd ways).

## Guidelines

NSF is very particular about meeting requirements: this keeps it fair for all, and at least not awful for reviewers (no getting around page limits by uploading things in 6 point font). Grants not meeting requirements are returned without review, meaning you won't get funded, nor even get useful feedback from reviewers.

Some sample guidelines:
* standard 8.5" x 11" page size
* 12-point, Times New Roman font or Computer Modern (LaTeX) font
* 10-point font may be used for references, footnotes, figure captions and text within figures
* 1" margins on all sides
* Single-spaced (approximately 5 lines per inch) or greater line spacing. Applicants should not use line spacing options such as "exactly 12 point," that are less than single spaced.

Refer to the program solicitation  (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16588/nsf16588.htm) for more about the guidelines for this grant, and the Grant Proposal Guide (known to all as the "GPG"): http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf16001/gpg_index.jsp. One reason you have to go through the research office is so that people who know this backwards and forwards make sure you're in compliance. Make sure you cite properly, meet the page limits using appropriate fonts, and you're already most of the way there. Note that only material within the pages of the proposal will be reviewed; from NSF: "Applicants should not send extraneous information or materials such as manuscripts, resumes, medical reports, or news clippings."

More immediately relevant are the requirements specific to this solicitation:

* Personal Information (through Fastlane)
* Education, Work and Other Experience
* Electronic transcripts
  * In the application, applicants must list their baccalaureate institution, as well as all graduate institutions attended with a start date prior to the fall term in which the application is submitted. Transcripts are required for all institutions listed. If the applicant started at the current institution in the fall of the application year and the institution does not provide unofficial or official transcripts prior to completion of the first term, the applicant may submit a class schedule/enrollment verification form in place of a transcript. Transcripts must be submitted electronically through the FastLane GRFP Application Module by the Field of Study application deadline.
* Proposed Field(s) of Study
* Proposed Graduate Study and Graduate School Information
* The names and email addresses of at least three reference letter writers
* Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement (3 page limit)
* Graduate Research Plan Statement (2 page limit)

These page limits include all references, citations, charts, figures, images, and lists of publications and presentations




## For letter writers


* Institutional (or professional) letterhead, if available
* Two (2) page limit
* 12-point Times New Roman in the body of the letter
* Name and title of reference writer
* Department and institution or organization

The reference letter should address the NSF Merit Review Criteria of **Intellectual Merit** *and* **Broader Impacts**. It should include
* details explaining the nature of the relationship to the applicant
* comments on the applicant's potential for contributing to a globally-engaged United States science and engineering workforce
* statements about the applicant's academic potential and prior research experiences
* statements about the applicant's proposed research
* any other information to aid review panels in evaluating the application according to the NSF Merit Review Criteria.
